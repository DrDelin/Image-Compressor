# IMAGE COMPRESSOR
  ## History of developement of this program:
Hi all! As nowadays all exam applications, government services, banking went online, it requires our image file for account creation or application stuff.  But limitation is most of our modern phone take picture >5 MB in size.  But these applications require image <150KB. Everytime it takes time to compress the image. And meanwhile compressing, have to crop or compromise the quality of image to achieve the size.  Uploading the image to internet-based image compressor have its own risks.  So i decided to create a small project using ffmpeg and somewhat minimal knowledge in python scripting, i developed this program.  As it is successful, i'm hoping this will help others who are facing same issue like me, so I shared here for all.
