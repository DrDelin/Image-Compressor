# IMAGE COMPRESSOR
  ### History of developement of this program:
    Hi all! I'm a college graduate, and i'm in preparing for post-graduation entrance examination. But for every exam, application forms, as well as creating an online account requires my image. But limitation is most of our modern phone take picture >5 MB in size. But these applications require my image <150KB. Everytime it takes time to compress the image. And meanwhile compressing, i have to crop or compromise the quality of image to achieve the size. Uploading the image to internet based image compressor have its own risks. So i decided to create a small project using ffmpeg and somewhat minimal knowledge in python scripting, i developed this program. As it is successful, i'm hoping this will help others who are facing same issue like me, so I shared here for all.
